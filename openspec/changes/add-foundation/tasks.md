## Implementation strategy

**The thin-MVP subset has been split out into its own OpenSpec change: [`bootstrap-thin-mvp`](../bootstrap-thin-mvp/proposal.md).** That change is the authoritative contract for the first end-to-end working slice. This `add-foundation` change remains the canonical record of the full v0 vision; the deferred capability subsets it describes (full knowledge graph, intent classifier, rerank+compress, OPA enforcement, additional connectors, enrichment workers, full admin UI, OTel/Grafana stack, `local-prod` profile) will each be picked up by their own follow-up changes that MODIFY the requirements `bootstrap-thin-mvp` set.

## 1. Repository scaffolding

- [ ] 1.1 Create monorepo layout: `services/{mcp-server,pipeline,enrichment,ingestion,admin-ui}`, `packages/shared`, `infra/{compose,opa,otel,grafana,postgres}`, `docs/`
- [ ] 1.2 Add root `package.json` (workspaces) and `pnpm-workspace.yaml` for TypeScript services
- [ ] 1.3 Add root `pyproject.toml` with `uv` workspace and per-service `pyproject.toml` files for Python services
- [ ] 1.4 Add `Makefile` with `bootstrap`, `up`, `up-dev`, `down`, `test`, `lint`, `format`, `migrate`, `seed`, `smoke` targets
- [ ] 1.5 Add `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`, root `.env.example`
- [ ] 1.6 Add `opencg.yaml` default config with the schema from D7 and an example commented out

## 2. Storage layer

- [ ] 2.1 Postgres image based on `postgres:16` with Apache AGE compiled in (custom Dockerfile in `infra/postgres/`)
- [ ] 2.2 Initial migration: catalog tables (`entity`, `entity_lineage`, `freshness`), graph vocabulary (`relationship_vocab`), audit (`audit_log` partitioned by week, immutability trigger), usage signals
- [ ] 2.3 AGE schema bootstrap: create graph `opencg`, add label types per relationship vocabulary
- [ ] 2.4 Qdrant compose service with persistent volume; bootstrap script that creates `<tenant>__<source>` collections with dense + sparse vector params
- [ ] 2.5 Valkey compose service with persistent volume
- [ ] 2.6 OPA compose service mounting `infra/opa/policies/` with a default `allow_internal_only` policy and a `health` rule
