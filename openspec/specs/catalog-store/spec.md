# Catalog Store

## Purpose

Store and manage tenant-scoped knowledge entities, including indexed administration queries and soft deletion.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Direct query

The catalog store SHALL accept structured filter queries from the admin UI via the pipeline's `GET /entities` endpoint and MUST evaluate them using existing indexes (`entity_classification_ix`, `entity_freshness_ix`, the `entity_source_uri_uq` covering source). No body-text scan is permitted for the admin list query.

#### Scenario: Admin list filters use indexed columns

- **WHEN** the pipeline queries the catalog with filters `(source, classification, freshness_state)` and pagination `(limit, offset)`
- **THEN** the query plan touches indexed columns only (`EXPLAIN` shows index scans, no sequential scan over `entity`)

### Requirement: Tombstone (soft delete)

The catalog store SHALL support a soft-delete operation that sets `tombstoned_at = now()` on the targeted row. Tombstoning MUST be idempotent: re-tombstoning a row preserves the original `tombstoned_at`. The operation MUST NOT remove the row, MUST NOT mutate any other column, and MUST NOT cascade.

#### Scenario: Tombstone is idempotent

- **WHEN** a caller tombstones an already-tombstoned row
- **THEN** the row's `tombstoned_at` is unchanged
- **AND** no other column is modified

#### Scenario: Tombstoned rows are excluded from retrieval

- **WHEN** an entity is tombstoned
- **THEN** subsequent calls to `lexical_search` from the retrieval pipeline do not return it
- **AND** the Qdrant payload still contains the entity until a future change adds tombstone-aware vector cleanup

### Requirement: Admin list query

The catalog store SHALL expose a function callable from the pipeline that lists entities with filters `(tenant, source?, classification?, freshness_state?)`, sorted by `updated_at DESC`, paginated by `(limit, offset)`. It MUST also return a `total` count for the same filter set (single round-trip is acceptable; a second SELECT count is acceptable in v1).

#### Scenario: List with all filters

- **WHEN** the pipeline calls the list function with `tenant="default", source="git", classification="internal", freshness_state="fresh", limit=50, offset=0`
- **THEN** the function returns an ordered slice of rows plus a `total` matching the count of rows satisfying the same filters

#### Scenario: List without filters

- **WHEN** the pipeline calls the list function with only `tenant` and pagination
- **THEN** all entities for the tenant are eligible
- **AND** results are ordered by `updated_at DESC`

### Requirement: Symbol-aware chunk id derivation

For chunks produced by the symbol chunker (code files processed by `chunk_code_by_symbols`), the catalog store SHALL derive the chunk `entity_id` as `uuid5(_SYMBOL_NS, f"{parent_entity_id}:{symbol_id}")` where `symbol_id` is graphifyy's stable per-symbol identifier. For oversized symbols that get paragraph-split, the seed MUST include the sub-chunk index: `uuid5(_SYMBOL_NS, f"{parent_entity_id}:{symbol_id}:{sub_index}")`.

For chunks produced by the paragraph chunker (text, markdown, future PDF / HTML / MDX), the catalog store SHALL continue to derive the chunk `entity_id` as `uuid5(_CHUNK_NS, f"{parent_entity_id}:{chunk_index}")` as established by `bootstrap-thin-mvp`.

Both schemes MUST be deterministic: re-ingest of an unchanged input MUST produce the same chunk id.

#### Scenario: Stable symbol-chunk id across re-ingest

- **WHEN** a Python file with three functions is ingested twice without changes
- **THEN** the same three `entity_id` values appear in `cortex.entity` both times
- **AND** the upsert path is taken (no duplicate rows)

#### Scenario: Adding a function above existing ones does not renumber

- **WHEN** a developer adds a new function `helper_a` at the top of a Python file that previously had `existing_b` and `existing_c`
- **THEN** the chunks for `existing_b` and `existing_c` retain their original `entity_id` values
- **AND** a new chunk row is created for `helper_a`
- **AND** the vector index does not require re-upserting the unchanged chunks

#### Scenario: Oversized symbol sub-chunks share the parent symbol id

- **WHEN** a function whose body exceeds the symbol size limit is paragraph-split into N sub-chunks
- **THEN** each sub-chunk row carries the same parent symbol id in metadata
- **AND** each sub-chunk's entity_id is distinct via the sub_index seed

### Requirement: Evidence linkage between chunks and edges

The catalog store SHALL host a join table `cortex.relationship_evidence(edge_id, entity_id, span TEXT, extractor_version TEXT, confidence FLOAT, created_at TIMESTAMPTZ)` linking each candidate edge to the chunk(s) it was extracted from. `entity_id` MUST be a FK into `cortex.entity`. Cascading delete of a tombstoned chunk MUST NOT remove evidence rows; tombstoning is soft, and evidence is retained for audit replay.

The catalog store SHALL expose a helper `get_evidence_chunks(edge_id) -> list[EntityRef]` used by the admin UI to render evidence per edge.

#### Scenario: Evidence is written alongside a candidate edge

- **WHEN** the extractor inserts a candidate edge derived from chunk `C1`
- **THEN** a `relationship_evidence` row is written linking that edge to `C1`

#### Scenario: Tombstoning a chunk preserves evidence

- **WHEN** an admin tombstones a chunk that supports a candidate edge
- **THEN** the `relationship_evidence` row is preserved
- **AND** the chunk's body is still fetchable via `GET /entities/{id}` (which already returns tombstoned rows)
